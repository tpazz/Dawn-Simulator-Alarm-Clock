COM3505 Panic Button
===

This project provides a way to signal panic to others, e.g. security staff. In
order to be a useful panic button, we need a way to find our location and
report this.

This could be provided by a GPS chip, however these consume a moderate amount
of power and take a fair amount of time to initialise and get a 'first fix'.
In addition they don't work well in urban canyons (between buildings) or
indoors.

We will be using a cunning technique that relies on the relative strength of
wireless signals. By comparing the signal strength seen by a device with a
map of access points the location of the device can be inferred through
triangulation.

Google has already done the tedious task of collecting the location of
millions of wireless access points and makes an API available (to developers)
that takes a list of wireless signals in the location, and returns a latitude
and longitude co-ordinate.

Github user @gmag11 has contributed code for the ESP32 that uses the google
API to return location data - [Google location
code](https://github.com/gmag11/ESPWifiLocation).

You will need to get a google API key from [Google Geolocation
API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/get-api-key).
